NOTE FOR JAY: If things go horribly wrong, this is based on W8_ZooManager_HW.zip from Winter 2023, which was the 4th part of the project that had 2 in-class projects with 1 good homework (W7) and 1 less-good one (W8).

The idea here is to start from a trimmed-down version of W8 that is a bit more game-like:

* Goal is to fill every square

* The Zoo is 4x4 until every square is occupied and then it expands randomly in one direction

* Animals get slower (lose initiative) each turn that they don't "attack". Animals that reach an initiative higher than 9 are removed from the board. (This means mice "live" longer if they have grass. Elephants can "attack" everything except mice, which means their higher initiative is OK.
